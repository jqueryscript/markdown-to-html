## Development

To run this project locally for development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    # Replace this with your actual repository URL
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `npm` for package management.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build assets:**
    To compile and minify the CSS and JavaScript files, run the build script. I have also added a convenient `build` script that runs both commands.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will:
    -   Process `input.css` with Tailwind CSS and create the final `style.css`.
    -   Minify `script.js` into `script.min.js`.

4.  **Open in browser:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the application.
