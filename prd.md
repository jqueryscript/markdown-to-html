Left Input Area: Support pasting HTML code.

Conversion Engine: Accurately converts HTML tags (such as <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <a>, <img>, etc.) into corresponding Markdown syntax.

3.3. Webpage (URL) to Markdown Converter
User Story: As an information collector, I want to be able to enter a URL and have the tool automatically extract the main content of the webpage and organize it into clearly structured Markdown text.

Feature Requirements:

Optional Content Extraction: Identify and extract the article body, and provide options to remove irrelevant elements such as advertisements, navigation bars, sidebars, and footers.

Formatting Preservation: Preserves the original text's heading hierarchy, lists, quotes, images, and links whenever possible.

Image Handling: Provides options to determine whether to retain the original image link or attempt to convert it to Base64 and embed it.

3.4. Markdown Online Editor
User Story: As a writer, I need a split-screen online editor that allows me to write Markdown while seeing the rendered results in real time, and with a convenient toolbar to assist me.

Feature Requirements:

Split-screen View: Markdown input area on the left, live preview area on the right, with synchronized scrolling.

Syntax Highlighting: Markdown syntax should be highlighted within the editor to improve readability.

Quick Toolbar: Provides shortcuts for commonly used Markdown syntax (such as bold, italics, inserting links, inserting images, creating tables, etc.).

Local Storage: Automatically save user input to the browser's LocalStorage to prevent content loss due to accidental closing.

Import/Export: Support uploading .md files from your local computer and downloading the current content as .md or .html files.

4. Recommended New Featured Tools
To further enhance the product's competitiveness, we recommend adding the following tools:

Markdown Linter/Formatter:

Function: Streamline messy Markdown code to create a consistent style (for example, standardize list symbols to -, correct spacing between headings, etc.). This is particularly useful for collaborative teams.

Markdown Table Generator:

Function: Provides a visual interface for creating and editing Markdown tables. Users simply enter the number of rows and columns and the content, and the correctly formatted table code is automatically generated, solving the pain points of handwritten tables.

Export to PDF/Image:

Function: Allows users to directly export edited or converted content as high-quality PDF files or PNG/JPEG images, greatly expanding the tool's application scenarios.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Core conversion functionality should be performed on the front-end whenever possible, ensuring millisecond-level response times.

Privacy: Clearly inform users that purely front-end functionality does not send user data to the server. For services that require back-end functionality (such as URL-to-MD conversion), a clear privacy policy should be maintained.

UI/UX: The interface design should be simple, intuitive, and ad-free. Responsive design should be adopted to ensure a positive experience on devices of all sizes.

Security: All user input will be strictly sanitized, especially in the HTML-to-Markdown conversion function, to prevent XSS attacks.

6. Revenue Model Consideration (Optional)

Completely free and login-free. Profitability will primarily come from on-page AdSense.

7. Future Roadmap
Phase 1 (MVP): Implement and launch the two core features of "Markdown to HTML Converter" and "HTML to Markdown Converter."

Phase 2 (Functional Expansion): Gradually launch auxiliary tools such as "Markdown Online Editor," "URL to Markdown," and a table generator.
