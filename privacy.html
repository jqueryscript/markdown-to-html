            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><em>Last updated: August 16, 2025</em></p>
            <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a template and not legal advice. Please consult with a legal professional to ensure this policy is appropriate for your needs.</p>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Free Markdown to HTML Converter (the "Service", "we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our website located at https://www.markdownhtmlgen.com/ (the "Website").</p>

            <h2>1. Core Principle: Privacy First</h2>
            <p>Our core service—the conversion of Markdown to HTML—is built on the principle of privacy first. All conversion and processing of the text or files you provide happens entirely within your web browser on your computer (client-side). <strong>We do not send, store, or have any access to the content you paste or upload for conversion.</strong></p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>While we do not collect any personal data from the content you convert, we do use third-party services that may collect data to help us understand and improve our service.</p>
            <h3>a) Website Analytics</h3>
            <p>We use Google Analytics to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behavior patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone.</p>
            <p>The data collected by Google Analytics may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your device's IP address (in an anonymized form)</li>
                <li>Browser type and version</li>
                <li>Operating system</li>
                <li>Geographic location (at the country or city level)</li>
                <li>Pages you visit on our Website and time spent on those pages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more information on how Google uses this data, please review their policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a>. You can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>

            <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
            <p>Google Analytics uses cookies to distinguish one user from another and to track usage statistics. Cookies are small text files stored on your device. You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish – for details, see aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. While no electronic storage is 100% secure, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any data collected by our analytics partners.</p>

            <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
